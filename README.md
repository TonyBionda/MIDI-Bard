# MIDI-Bard

## Introduction

MIDI-Bard is an innovative software tool designed to bridge the gap between musical creativity and digital
functionality. By converting MIDI keyboard inputs into conventional keyboard strokes, MIDI-Bard allows musicians and
enthusiasts to use their MIDI devices to interact with applications that do not natively support MIDI. This is
particularly useful in environments like the popular MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV), where players can perform music
using the in-game Bard class without direct MIDI support.

## Functionality

- **MIDI to Keyboard Mapping**: Converts real-time MIDI keyboard inputs into corresponding keyboard strokes.
- **Customizable Mapping**: Users can define which MIDI inputs correspond to specific keyboard outputs, allowing for
  personalized setups.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to work seamlessly with any software that accepts keyboard input, enhancing usability
  and creative potential.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Requires minimal system resources, ensuring smooth performance even during extensive
  use.
